# Workflow 

## Autocorrelation for a known structure

We used a simulated image and observed its autocorrelation. This served as instruction to what a similar operation on our data must look like.

The autocorrelation for this image is

Next we looked at a treated SAXS image file. The data was made symmetric by mirroring it about the beamstop centre. This is seen in the image below.

Finally we applied a [DCT](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/phelpsforpresident/MIC-XRD-Polymer/blob/gh-pages/notebooks/Relationship_between_XRD_and_Autocorrelation.ipynb) to this image and hoped that the autocorrelation from above and the DCT would be similar. As you can see, they are not.
