In this post we will show streamlines created by using PCA on X-scattering images, and a derivation to get the
relationship between SAXS intensity images and autocorrelation for a local state

# Processing Streamline from X-ray Scattering Intensity Images

The images below are three images of processing streamlines for twelve samples that an applied strain at each time
step.

# Load - Strain Behaviour for the samples explored in PCA Space

At each time step (also the strain step in this case) we have access to the % crystallinity measurements
obtained independently of the SAXS data. We expect to map tthe strain and percent crystallinity to 
the reduced data inorder to develop predictive analytics for new microstructures.

# Autocorrelation of a Local State from SAXS Data and Volume Fraction

This [derivation](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/phelpsforpresident/MIC-XRD-Polymer/blob/gh-pages/notebooks/Relationship_between_XRD_and_Autocorrelation.ipynb)
shows how to come up with the following relationship between SAXS intensity images, volume fraction and autocorrelation
of one local state for a system with only 2 local states.

\begin{eqnarray}
f^{11}( \\pmb x) = \\frac{1}{V \\eta_o^2} \\int I (\\pmb k) e^{-i \\pmb k \\pmb x} d \\pmb k + V_1^2
\end{eqnarray}
If we can learn how to handle the portion of the data from the beam stop, we should be able to recover the 
autocorrelation for the crystalline state.
